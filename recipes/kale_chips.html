    <h2>Description by ChatGPT</h2>
    <p>
        Kale chips are a healthy snack made by baking kale leaves in the oven.
        The leaves are tossed with olive oil, salt, pepper, and nutritional yeast flakes for flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once baked, the kale becomes crispy and crunchy, making a light and crunchy snack.
